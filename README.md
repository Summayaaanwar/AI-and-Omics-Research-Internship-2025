# AI and Omics Research Internship 2025 â€“ My Work

This repository contains all the work I completed as part of the AI and Omics Research Internship 2025, focused on developing skills in data analysis, machine learning, and omics research using R programming.

# Internship Overview
During this internship, I worked through a series of theory and practical modules designed to build a foundation in:

ðŸ”¹ R programming for data analysis

ðŸ”¹ Handling and processing high-dimensional biological data

ðŸ”¹ Applying machine learning methods in biomedical research

ðŸ”¹ Genomics and transcriptomics data workflows

The sessions combined live lectures, coding exercises, and assignments. This repository organizes my submissions, notes, and cleaned scripts for revision and reference.

# Topics Covered
Class I (Theory): Introduction to Machine Learning & Linear Regression

Class IA (Practical): R Installation and Data Wrangling

Class IB (Practical): Basic Operations in R â€“ working directories, data types, projects
